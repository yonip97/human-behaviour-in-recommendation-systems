    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the domain of information retrieval, which is closely related to recommendation systems, the objective of the information retrieval system is to retrieve relevant information from a large collection of data in response to a user's query. It does so by finding the documents with the highest probability of being relevant to the userâ€™s query.\n",
    "But the objective of the content creators, the ones who are creating the data, is to get as many people as possible to read their content (like news sites), buy products from them (like amazon, eBay and etc.) or to expose visitors to advertisement on the site. For all those reasons, content creators objective is to get people to chose their document to consume.\n",
    "Because content creators want the highest exposure (as it usually translates to more users consuming their data), they would want to be ranked as high as possible to as many queries as possible. So, content creators might change their content, to be ranked higher and receive higher exposure, even if the changes are superficial and meant only for the benefit of higher ratings.\n",
    "And because not all queries carry the same value (for example, a user searching for a new phone carries much more value to an Ecommerce site than a user searching for bottle water), then content creators might want to tailor their data to fit best to the higher value queries.\n",
    "In our work, we chose to explore how such strategic behavior of the content creators affects the overall performance of the information retrieval system, and the affect of the strategic behavior of the content creators on their revenue.\n"
